# Introduction to Requirements Engineering

During a Software Development in Software Engineering, there are various process and life cicles. All of them have something in common: the comprehension of problems to be solved, the definition of what is going to get done. To this step, we give the name of 'Requirements Engineering'.

#### Conceptualization

The principal result wanted by using Requirements Engineering are it's sets of requirements, which are:

- Be reference for a software or service defined;
- Possibilitate an agreement between the interested people (customer, users, providers and developers);
- Be validated in relation to the needs of a real world;
- Be implementable;
- Provides reference to project veryfing.

"A iterative process, incrementative, cognitive, social, comunicative and creative, which goals are to know, understand, estruturate, represent, comunicate and transcribe the useful information of a system"
</code>

RE (Requirements Engineering) acts as the bridge between the real users needs, clients and other groups affected by a software system and the potencialities and oportunities offereds by technology.

#### Motivations for RE

Requirements especifies the expected behavior of based on the customer's vision

<b>Quality of a system depends necessarily of the quality of the requirements.</b> [Wrong Requirements = Wrong System]

Requirements can be used to determine the deadline and cost of the project.

#### What RE does?

In a general way, Requirements Engineering executes the same activities on traditional and agile processes.

However, the philosophy (traditional or agile) is what sustains these executions, making that activities to be done on a singular way.

- It stablishes a <b>common vision</b> between the client and the project team about the requirements that's going to be accomplished by the software.

- Documents and controls the requirements allocated to gerencial use of the software engineering.

- Keep artefacts and activities of software consistent with the allocated requirements.

- It is present on all the software development.

#### What may happen if RE is not used?

- The software product may be a excelent one, but not for the specific problem that needs to be solved;
- Loss of money and time
- Personal frustration
- Unsatisfied customers

#### Who is involved on RE?

<u>It depends</u> of the software development aproaching, the project complexity and the team competency.

But, in general:

- Software Engineer
- Systems Analyst
- Business Analyst
- Requirements Specifier
- Requirements Reviewer
- Stakeholders

#### How to do RE?

<b>Elicitation of requirements:</b>

- Use of sistematic techniques, such as prototyping and structured searches to identify and documentate the needs of the client and the final user;

<b>Requirements analysis:</b>

- The needs, premisses and other information of the interested parts, identifieds during the elicitation, are combined and refined in aditional levels of detailment.

<b>Specification of Software Requirements:</b>

- Structured collection of essential requirements (function, performance, design restrictions and attributes) of the software and it's external interfaces

<b>Requirements Validation:</b>

- Confirmation that requirements (individually and as a group) define itself as the right system intended by the interested parts.

<b>Requirements verification:</b>

- Confirmation by exam that the requirements (individually and as a group) are well formed.

<b>Requirements management:</b>

- Activities that identify, document, maintain, comunnicate and seek the requirements during the life cicle of the system, product or service.

#### What is a Requirements Engineering Artefact?

<b>Specification of Software Requirements:</b> a effective representation of what must be produced on the software.

Requirements of software can be presented using (for example):

- Prototypes;
- Specifying documents;
- Models.

#### What is a requirement?

<u>It is a declaration that translates or express the needs, restrictions associated and conditions</u> (ISO-IEC-IEEE 29148).

System requirements are services descriptions that that must be provided for the system

It is a quality that the software must presents.

#### What are the levels and types of requirements?

It can be functional or not functional.

Functional: a functionality the software must has.

Not functional: flexibility, portability, 
maintainability.

#### Requirements quality

The requirements quality is a fundamental factor for the success of the software product to be built.

Both traditional and agile methodologies aim for requirements quality. Although, the moment of verification of that quality can occur in different moments.

- <b>Testable:</b> Is there any effective process in terms of cost vs benefits that shows if the product attends to the requirement?

    The system must suports until 500 simultaneous accesses.
    
    The system must responds to any search in a time minor than 500ms.

    The system must runs on 24/7.

- <b>Correct:</b> the requirement contains all the necessary information, according to the client needs?

- <b>Complete:</b> the specification contains all the significant and needed requirements, such as: functionality, performance, restrictions and external interfaces?

- <b>Not ambiguous:</b> It must have only one interpretation (being clear to the client and to the developers).

- <b>Consistent if:</b> there is no duplicity.
