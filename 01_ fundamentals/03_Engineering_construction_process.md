# Engineering Construction Process

#### How it Works? (introduction):

1. The clients explain to the engineers and architects what they want as the product (it's appearance, characteristics ...).

    - It's not expected that the clients will describe all the product in the beginning of the process. So, the project may have changes during the construction;

2. the Software Developing Team must present a project (architecture) and a plain of construction.

3. The project and the plain of construction are discussed between the client and the professionals, until it's approved.

4. The team of professionals is alocated by it's skills.

5. Finally, <b>the construction begins!!</b>
