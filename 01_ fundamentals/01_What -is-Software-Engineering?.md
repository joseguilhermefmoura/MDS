# What is Software Engineering?

#### Introduction:

ISO/IEC/IEE Systems and Software Engineering Vocabulary (SEVOCAB) defines 'software engineering' as

<code>
"the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software."
</code>

#### Software Engineering:

Software is more than just the code of some program. A program is a executable code, that serves for a computational purpouse. The software is considered as the <u><b>colection of executable programming code</b></u>, <u><b>libraries</b></u> and <u><b>documentations</b></u>; all associated between themselves.


Software, when built for a specific requirement is called software product.
Engineering, on the other side, has all to do with the development of these products, using principles and scientific methods strongly well defined.

<b>So, in resume, Software Engineering searches for develop software products (collection of executable programming code, libraries and documentations), using principles and scientific methods strongly well defined.</b>
