# Topics on Software Engineering Construction Process

#### Introduction:

To the construction of software, in order to solutionate a problem <b>methodologies, process, procedures, methods and tools</b>.

## Methodology:

Methodology is the disciplin that studies and orders (if it's possible) the many methods we conceive, it's historical origins, it's 
paradigmatics bases followed by it's theoretical relations, it's structural characteristics and its target specifications.
- <em>methodos</em> = the way to get to an end
- <em>logia</em> = study of something

Examples in Software Engineer: structured methodology, agile methodology, object oriented methodology ...

## Process:

<b>A series of steps composed by activities</b> that transform inputs in to outputs are called processes. 
It evolves a set of techniques (methods), tools, restrictions and resources.

Examples: requirements, design, programming ...

## Software Process:

A common <b>structure formed by a set of sistematically aplicable activities</b> in software projects, with the main goal of generate a software product.

It's activities can be partially <b>ordenated and grouped on levels, where which one of them have roles and responsabilities associated</b>, in order to transform inputs in to outputs.

It can be said that a software process stabilishes <b>who does what, how and when</b>, to accomplish a specific goal.

#### Why to use a Software Process?

- To orientate actions allowing to examinate, understand, control and aprimorate the activities that compose the software process.

- To capture experiences and distribute to the team;

- To standalize the activities and products, garanteeing consistency and structure to a set of activities.

## Procedures:

Procedurements are the way of act and do something. It can be like a guide, a structured way to combine tools and skills to generate a result.

#### Process and Procedures:

EXAMPLE:

The process demands the project products must be reviewed before programmed.
- The avaliation can be done with reviewing or formal inspection.
- Each type of reviewing has a procedure, but both with the same goal.


## Methods:

Method is the way we do something, the way of act to get to a goal; it demands the knowledge organization and experience.

Example: design techniques, programming techniques, data modelation techniques, etc ...

## Tools:

Tool is an strument to realize a task in the better way.

Example: Kanbam, to-do-list, Azure, GitHub...


## In resume:

<b> Methodologies (philosophical understanding) supports the Process (set of activities) orientated by Procedures (guide and way to do) that is supported by Methods (formal technique) and Tools (instruments). </b>
