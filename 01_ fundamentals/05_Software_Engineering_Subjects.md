# Software Engineering Subjects

## Engineering subjects:

#### Software Requirements:

"Is concerned with the elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of software requirements as well as the management of requirements during the whole life cycle of the software product"

#### Software Design:

"The process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces and other characteristics of a sytem or component and the result of that process"

#### Software Construction:

"The detailed creation of working software through a combination of coding, verification, unit testing, integration testing, and debugging"

#### Software Testing: 

"Consists of the dynamic verification that a program provides expected behaviors on a finite set of test cases, suitably selected from the usually infinite execution domain"

## Support subjects:

#### Software Maintenance:

"The maintenance phase of the life cycle begins following a warranty period or postimplementation support delivery, bu maintenance activities occur much earlier"

#### Software Configuration Management:

"Configuration management (CM), then, is the discipline of identifying the configuration of a system at distinct points in time for the purpose of systematically controlling changes tto the configuration and maintaining the integrity and traceability of the configuration throughout the system life cycle."

#### Software Engineering Management:

"Can be defined as the application of management activities: planning, coordinating, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and reporting; to ensure that software products and software engineering services are delivered efficiently, effectively and to the benefit of stakeholders"

#### Software Quality:

"Software quality may refer: to desirable characteristics of software products, to the extent to which a particular software product possess those characteristics, and to processes, tools, and techniques used to achieve those characteristics."

"Conformance to requirements."

#### Software Engineering Process:

"Consists of a set of interrelated activities that transform one or more inputs into outputs while consuming resources to accomplish the transformation."

"... concerned with work activities accomplished by software engineers to develop, maintin, and operate software, such as requirements, design, construction, testing, configuration management, and other software engineering processes."
